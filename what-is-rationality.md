# History of rationality

## Ancient Greece

Ancient Greece is often seen as the cradle of modern rationality. Let's look at how it got that reputation.

Athens instituted the first democracy I'm aware of. In democratic Athens, every citizen could influence city policy by means of persuasion in the popular legislature. In this society, strong persuasive abilities had many practical benefits.

The desire to learn persuasive skills was one major driver of demand for teachers, such as the sophists, who made a living providing private tutoring in philosophy and rhetoric, probably most often to the wealthy.

Greek thinkers made fundamental advances in rationality.

* Euclid studied geometry, providing our first example I'm aware of a systematic mathematical theory where all facts are proven from a set of axioms.
* Aristotle formulated the theory of syllogistic reasoning. This is the first example I'm aware of of a formal system of logic, saying what inferences were logically valid for statements in a certain restricted class.
* Greek philosophers constructed sophisticated philosophical arguments, many of which are still quality arguments by the standards of modern philosophy. The Socratic dialogues are one good source of such arguments.
* Greeks studied fundamental problems of epistemology. [Skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism) of various forms was popular in the philosophical community. One form of skepticism is the belief that knowledge is not possible for humans. This view is still hard to refute (which is not to imply that it's true).

The Romans assimilated and built upon Greek thinking. They exported it through their empire to much of Afro-Eurasia. When the Roman Empire fell, Christian monasteries in Western Europe preserved Greco-Roman knowledge through the Dark Ages. Much Medieval learning in Western Europe was concerned with absorbing Greco-Roman knowledge. The Age of Enlightenment was to a great extent driven by Greco-Roman ideas and values, particularly [liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism). Eventually, Western European colonialism and internationalism would export Enlightenment ideas and values to every time zone. This illustrates the extent of the influence of Greco-Roman thought.

The ideals of the Enlightenment include liberalism and rationality. Both ideas are highly Greco-Roman, in content and to some extent inspiration. Rationality, for reasons already explained. Liberalism is Greco-Roman in the sense that the Greeks and the earlier Romans were early liberals, in the sense that they lived in very free, open societies, and they were the first large-scale democracies.

An influential perspective on rationality emerged from the formal study of reasoning pioneered by the likes of Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. Frege and Russell appreciated the importance of the connection between reasoning and language, and their work further demonstrated its importance. By providing a rigorous, mathematical analysis of the essential structure of declarative, factual language, they were able to formulate rigorous, mathematical rules of reasoning which can be used to understand much reasoning in all domains. These rules have particular utility in understanding mathematical reasoning.

The works of Ludwig Wittgenstein emerged, in my understanding, somewhat as a reaction to the Frege-Russell perspective on reasoning. Wittgenstein agreed on the importance of the connection between language and reasoning. However, he ultimately provided a radically different understanding of language than the one suggested by Frege and Russell's formal analysis.

XXX: Explain the view I'm refuting, ala Frege, Russell

At the end of the day, rationality is a *praxis*. It is something that we do, rather than something we understand. There is a lot of academic theory involved in modern rationality. This theory is important. But, somebody who has a grasp of the academic theory relevant to rationality is not, thereby, rational. The heart of rationality is something we can't explain; our understanding of ourselves isn't advanced enough for us to figure it out.

One good way of defining rationality is as the *praxis* involved in thinking in such a way as to be correct, and in making decisions in such a way as to be maximally assured of achieving our goals. In [Eliezer Yudkowsy's words](http://lesswrong.com/lw/7i/rationality_is_systematized_winning/), rationality is systematized winning.

Like all philosophical theses, this conception can surely be picked at. It's a pretty good way of thinking about rationality, though. It gives us a key principle of rationality, which is that rationality is not about adhering to a fixed set of rules. A rational person does what works. Our conceptions of what works can be overturned, so rationality does not have any fixed principles.

However, there are principles that have always worked, for which we can't conceive of any realistic scenarios where they wouldn't work within their established domains of applicability. These include the laws of logic, the laws of mathematics, and the scientific method.

The term "law" should not necessarily be understood here in the sense of "law of nature." For example, are the laws of mathematics laws of nature? Or are they conventions? There's [an entire field of philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-mathematics/) whose central question is essentially that. However, we can certainly say that mathematics and logic as practiced by humans are linguistic practices whose rules have been written down by humans, which we use because they work.

Are the laws of logic, the laws of mathematics, and the scientific method applicable to everything? Certainly not. They cannot tell us anything about what is good or bad, moral or immoral. They do not presently allow us to understand each other; we need to rely on feelings and intuition to understand each other. They do not tell us how to lead a happy life, a meaningful life, or a spiritual life.

Some people will argue that sufficiently advanced science and technology could allow us to understand each other and understand the secrets of happiness, meaning, and spiritual life through logic, math, and science. It may be true that sufficiently advanced understanding of neuroscience will shed light on all these topics.

This is largely an irrelevant point, because we don't possess the requisite science and technology to understand things in this way, and such science and technology appears to be a long way off, barring a [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity).

It also risks missing the significance of the [is-ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem) described by Hume. Intuitively, it seems clear that no set of purely descriptive, factual statements about the world logically entail any moral proposition, any statement of "ought."

Let's try it. "Jimmy *is* in pain," therefore "we *ought* to have sympathy for Jimmy." This argument has a suppressed premise, namely, "we ought to have sympathy for people who are in pain," which in turn appears to rest on more basic assumptions like "pain is bad" and "we ought to sympathize with people experiencing bad things." How do we justify these assumptions on the basis of factual claims?

We can also analyze the matter from a logical perspective. Suppose we have a set of premises P, and a word W. Suppose the word W never appears in P. Then it will be impossible to prove any statement using the word W, beyond logical tautologies and similar trivialities.

A more formal way of expressing this idea is that in first-order logic (or just about any other formal logic you care to choose), if you have a signature S, a predicate P in S, and a theory T over S, if P does not appear in any of the axioms of T then given any model M of T, replacing the interpretation of the predicate P with any other interpretation will still give a you a model of T. XXX: Reference where we unpack these concepts.

Applying the principle to the case of "ought," all observed facts are consistent with essentially any set of moral beliefs, because a purely factual statement is free of moral language. This is the is-ought problem, and it illustrates that no amount of scientific and technological development will provide a justificatory basis in scientific knowledge for our fundamental moral beliefs.

The lesson is that moral beliefs are out of the scope of what science, mathematics, and logic can tell us (though all three practices, especially logic, are important in moral discussions). We cannot reason about morality relying solely on science, mathematics, and logic. However, we can reason about morality, which illustrates that rationality takes in more than science, mathematics, and logic.

Legal reasoning is another good example. Doing law effectively, in my non-expert understanding, is essentially a matter of using language in clear and consistent ways, thinking through potential futures and accounting for them, and applying consistent principles to different cases. Legal reasoning is a subtle and informal style of reasoning which is nonetheless highly developed and overall well-suited to the problem it solves.






Rationality is not a natural state of the human mind. It's a state which is achieved through hard and determined effort towards the right kinds of goals. It's a state which is never perfectly achieved. One is never finished in the development of one's rationality. It's a life-long learning experience, a path not a destination.

The heart of rationality I also call the Tao of rationality. The Tao of rationality is a mystery, a placeholder for our lack of comprehensive understanding of our own ability to reason, consequent of our minds' present inability to comprehend themselves.

The Tao Te Ching purports to contain ancient wisdom applicable to every kind of problem. In this case we're mining it for wisdom about the practice of rationality. I'll give you a passage, and then I'll tell you what it brings to mind for me.

    The tao that can be told
    is not the eternal Tao
    The name that can be named
    is not the eternal Name.

    The unnamable is the eternally real.
    Naming is the origin
    of all particular things.

    Free from desire, you realize the mystery.
    Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.

    Yet mystery and manifestations
    arise from the same source.
    This source is called darkness.

[N.B. This passage is from chapter 1 of [Stephen Mitchell's translation of the Tao Te Ching](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html), for which I claim fair use. Consider buying it; it's a great book.]

Here's what that passage brings to mind for me.

Human ability to reason outruns our ability to understand our processes of reasoning on a second-order level. Reasoning is a capability of our minds. Our minds are very complex and our understanding of them is very rudimentary.

Our processes of reasoning are the outcome of a process of biological and social evolution, consisting of the Darwinian evolution of our brains and the transmission and evolution of intellectual DNA forward through history.

Our rules for reasoning are essentially encoded in our languages. Our languages are complex organs with many subdivisions such as mathematical language and technical jargon of various fields, which are outposts dotted around a complex, generalized "everyday" language.

The most important wisdom about reasoning is contained in the rules governing our everyday languages. Good argumentation is mostly a matter of using everyday language in a way which adheres rigorously to common sense best practices of clarity and thoroughness. In other words, deeply understanding common sense about how to use language when attempting to discern the truth is the most important aspect of the development of rationality. 

    The supreme good is like water,
    which nourishes all things without trying to.
    It is content with the low places that people disdain.
    Thus it is like the Tao.

    In dwelling, live close to the ground.
    In thinking, keep to the simple.
    In conflict, be fair and generous.

    [ch. 8]

Good reasoning is full of uniform and repeatable patterns. Some of these repeatable patterns can be systematized: for example, deductive logic, mathematics, and science all have a corpus of repeatable reasoning techniques of various degrees of formality. Understanding these patterns is important to the development of rationality.

However, knowing all the techniques of rationality does not give one the practical, procedural knowledge of being rational.

    When you have names and forms,
    know that they are provisional.
    When you have institutions,
    know where their functions should end.
    Knowing when to stop,
    you can avoid any danger.
    
    [ch. 32]

The heart of rationality is a groundedness in reality and a willingness to be swayed by reality created by a kind of emptiness and lack of preconception.

    We join spokes together in a wheel,
    but it is the center hole
    that makes the wagon move.

    We shape clay into a pot,
    but it is the emptiness inside
    that holds whatever we want.

    We hammer wood for a house,
    but it is the inner space
    that makes it livable.

    We work with being,
    but non-being is what we use.

    [ch. 11]
