Probably every adherent of rationality has a somewhat different idea of what rationality is. In this blog series I aim to present my conception of rationality. It is not authoritative; it is an opinion.

# My background

Here is some background on how I developed my conception of rationality. Since I admit my conception of rationality is only an opinion, I feel it's useful to explain why I think my opinion is worth the while. By describing in inspecific terms the life experiences that have led me to my conception of rationality, I hope to provide a resume of sorts.

This section is safely skippable; nothing afterwards depends on it.

I studied computer programming and electronic music production on my own time in high school; these were my first major experiences with higher cognition.

I became a more philosophical person after my first LSD experience. I became interested in Eastern mysticism and Western occultism, and I practiced meditation, Yoga, and occult rituals. I experimented with a wide variety of hallucinogens.

I studied a variety of major and obscure philosophical schools, including (in no particular order) existentialism, analytic philosophy, classical Western philosophy, Eastern philosophy, [Crowleyan occultism](http://hermetic.com/crowley/), the American drug-fueled academic mysticism of the 60s and 70s (a la Robert Anton Wilson's *Cosmic Trigger* and Timothy Leary's *Exo-Psychology*), and the academic UFO mysticism of [L/L Research](http://www.llresearch.org/), esp. the [Law of One](http://www.lawofone.info/). I suppose I was searching for the fundamental meaning of life.

The influence of my college professors and some of my smart friends led me to realize the problematic nature of the methods I was using to select my beliefs. The biggest early influence on me in this regard came from the [LessWrong rationality materials](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality_materials).

My philosophy became more analytical in this period, and I thought deeply to try to understand fundamental issues in epistemology, especially in connection with mysticism and spirituality. I was a deeply spiritual person at this time, so these were very live concerns for me.

My philosophical questions led me progressively deeper into higher math, especially the areas of mathematical logic and set theory. I studied math in classes, and went to graduate school to study philosophy, where I specialized in logic. I did original research at the intersection of math and philosophy, which I published in prestigious journals. Then I dropped out of school to pursue a career as a software developer. That's how I pay the bills today.

In philosophy school I spent thousands of hours studying the going rigorous academic theories of reasoning, including fields like formal logic, the foundations of mathematics, probability theory, and statistics. I gained a broad general education in higher math. I spent thousands of hours grappling with some of humanity's fuzziest, most intractable questions with my colleagues, across all fields of philosophy.

In comparison, the work I do as a software developer is simpler. It's very detail-oriented work which requires reasoning under imperfect information about inconceivably complex and chronically surprising objects (computers), and which has to be done perfectly for my company's high-profile clients. This is a tough grind, but I feel it's helped me to become less biased and more patient in my thinking.

I felt in retrospect that bias was rampant in the work done in the philosophy department I was in (including my work). It seemed that by the professional standards of analytic philosophy, it was OK to be biased, as long as you used arguments that were hard to refute. This is probably right as a professional standard, and it still allows for academic progress to flourish, but I do think it damages the profession in subtle ways that so many people accept the license to be biased.

In my work environment, I feel I need to reason in an unbiased way to avoid being eaten. There's a need to form judgments based on incomplete information about complex systems, and we need to actually get it right or there are significant consequences for the large corporations we serve. Achieving this requires employing elementary methods from logic and science, and most of all it requires the willingness to patiently grind through lots of little facts, and to consistently maintain a skeptical attitude where we are open to all hypotheses consistent with the observable facts. I feel that this environment has grown my capacity for neutrality.

Like everybody, my political awareness has grown over the course of my life. I was raised in a liberal environment. My parents are Unitarian Universalists. I haven't been naturally exposed to a significant amount of conservative thought in the course of my everyday life. 

The election of Trump was a wake-up call for me. It made me realize I didn't understand what was going on politically in my country. I also felt there was a general vacuum of neutral understanding of the present American political situation. I felt called to help with that problem.

I am still developing my conception of political rationality. Politics is of course the hardest topic of all to reason neutrally about. I'm bringing everything I've learned to bear on the problem, and seeking role models for neutral political reasoning.

This blog series is not primarily about my conception of political rationality. It's about my conception of rationality in general. However, analyzing generalities without getting into specifics is a crime against rationality, so political rationality is one of the areas I wish to discuss.
