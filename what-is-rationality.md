Probably every adherent of rationality has a somewhat different idea of what rationality is. In this blog series I aim to present my conception of rationality. It is not authoritative; it is an opinion.

# My background

Here is some background on how I developed my conception of rationality. Since I admit my conception of rationality is only an opinion, I feel it's useful to explain why I think my opinion is worth the while, by explaining the experiences that led to it.

This section is safely skippable; nothing afterwards depends on it.

I studied computer programming and electronic music production on my own time in high school; these were my first major experiences with higher cognition.

I became a more philosophical person after my first LSD experience. I became interested in Eastern mysticism and Western occultism, and I practiced meditation, Yoga, and occult rituals. I experimented with a wide variety of hallucinogens.

I studied a variety of major and obscure philosophical schools, including (in no particular order) existentialism, analytic philosophy, classical Western philosophy, Eastern philosophy, [Crowleyan occultism](http://hermetic.com/crowley/), the American drug-fueled academic mysticism of the 60s and 70s (a la Robert Anton Wilson's *Cosmic Trigger* and Timothy Leary's *Exo-Psychology*), and the academic extraterrestrial mysticism of [L/L Research](http://www.llresearch.org/), esp. the [Law of One](http://www.lawofone.info/). I suppose I was searching for the fundamental meaning of life.

The influence of my college professors and some of my smart friends led me to realize the problematic nature of the methods I was using to select my beliefs. The biggest early influence on me in this regard came from the [LessWrong rationality materials](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality_materials).

My philosophy became more analytical in this period, and I thought deeply to try to understand fundamental issues in epistemology, especially in their relationship with mysticism and spirituality. I was a deeply spiritual person at this time, so these were very live concerns for me.

My philosophical questions led me progressively deeper into higher math, especially the areas of mathematical logic and set theory. I studied math in classes, and went to graduate school to study philosophy, where I specialized in logic. I did original research at the intersection of math and philosophy, which I published in prestigious journals. Then I dropped out of school to pursue a career as a software developer. That's how I pay the bills today.

In philosophy school I spent hundreds of hours studying the going rigorous academic theories of reasoning, including fields like formal logic, the foundations of mathematics, probability theory, and statistics. I gained a broad general education in higher math. I spent hundreds of hours grappling with some of humanity's fuzziest, most intractable questions with my colleagues, ranging across all fields of philosophy.

In comparison, the work I do as a software developer is simpler. It's very detail-oriented work which requires reasoning under imperfect information about inconceivably complex and chronically surprising objects (computers), and which has to be done perfectly for my company's high-profile clients. This is a tough grind, but I feel it's helped me to become less biased and more patient in my thinking.

I felt in retrospect that bias was rampant in the work done in the philosophy department I was in (including my work). It seemed that by the professional standards of analytic philosophy, it was OK to be biased, as long as you used arguments that were hard to refute. This is probably right as a professional standard, and it still allows for academic progress to flourish, but I do think it damages the profession in subtle ways that so many people accept the license to be biased.

In my work environment, I feel I need to reason in an unbiased way to avoid being eaten. There's a need to form judgments based on incomplete information about complex systems, and we need to actually get it right or there are consequences for the large corporations we serve and potentially for thousands of everyday people. Achieving the level of correctness our problems demand requires employing elementary methods from logic and science, and most of all it requires the willingness to patiently grind through lots of little facts, and to consistently maintain a skeptical attitude where we are open to all hypotheses consistent with the observable facts. I feel that this environment has grown my capacity for neutrality.

Like everybody, my political awareness has grown over the course of my life. I am an American. I was raised in a liberal environment. My parents are Unitarian Universalists. I haven't been naturally exposed to a significant amount of conservative thought in the course of my everyday life. 

The election of Trump was a wake-up call for me. It made me realize I didn't understand what was going on politically in my country. I also felt there was a general vacuum of neutral understanding of the present American political situation. I felt called to help with that problem.

I am still developing my conception of political rationality. Politics is of course the hardest topic of all to reason neutrally about. I'm bringing everything I've learned to bear on the problem, and seeking role models for neutral political reasoning.

This blog series is not primarily about my conception of political rationality. It's about my conception of rationality in general. However, analyzing generalities without getting into specifics is a crime against rationality, so political rationality is one of the areas I wish to discuss.

# The Tao of rationality

XXX: Explain the view I'm refuting, ala Frege, Russell

At the end of the day, rationality is a *praxis*. It is something that we do, rather than something we understand. There is a lot of academic theory involved in modern rationality. This theory is important. But, somebody who has a grasp of the academic theory relevant to rationality is not, thereby, rational. The heart of rationality is something we can't explain; our understanding of ourselves isn't advanced enough for us to figure it out.

One good way of defining rationality is as the *praxis* involved in thinking in such a way as to be correct, and in making decisions in such a way as to be maximally assured of achieving our goals. In [Eliezer Yudkowsy's words](http://lesswrong.com/lw/7i/rationality_is_systematized_winning/), rationality is systematized winning.

Like all philosophical theses, this conception can surely be picked at. It's a pretty good way of thinking about rationality, though. It gives us a key principle of rationality, which is that rationality is not about adhering to a fixed set of rules. A rational person does what works. Our conceptions of what works can be overturned, so rationality does not have any fixed principles.

However, there are principles that have always worked, for which we can't conceive of any realistic scenarios where they wouldn't work within their established domains of applicability. These include the laws of logic, the laws of mathematics, and the scientific method.

The term "law" should not necessarily be understood here in the sense of "law of nature." For example, are the laws of mathematics laws of nature? Or are they conventions? There's [an entire field of philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-mathematics/) whose central question is essentially that. However, we can certainly say that mathematics and logic as practiced by humans are linguistic practices whose rules have been written down by humans, which we use because they work.

Are the laws of logic, the laws of mathematics, and the scientific method applicable to everything? Certainly not. They cannot tell us anything about what is good or bad, moral or immoral. They do not presently allow us to understand each other; we need to rely on feelings and intuition to understand each other. They do not tell us how to lead a happy life, a meaningful life, or a spiritual life.

Some people will argue that sufficiently advanced science and technology could allow us to understand each other and understand the secrets of happiness, meaning, and spiritual life through logic, math, and science. It may be true that sufficiently advanced understanding of neuroscience will shed light on all these topics.

This is largely an irrelevant point, because we don't possess the requisite science and technology to understand things in this way, and such science and technology appears to be a long way off, barring a [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity).

It also risks missing the significance of the [is-ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem) described by Hume. Intuitively, it seems clear that no set of purely descriptive, factual statements about the world logically entail any moral proposition, any statement of "ought."

Let's try it. "Jimmy *is* in pain," therefore "we *ought* to have sympathy for Jimmy." This argument has a suppressed premise, namely, "we ought to have sympathy for people who are in pain," which in turn appears to rest on more basic assumptions like "pain is bad" and "we ought to sympathize with people experiencing bad things." How do we justify these assumptions on the basis of factual claims?

We can also analyze the matter from a logical perspective. Suppose we have a set of premises P, and a word W. Suppose the word W never appears in P. Then it will be impossible to prove any statement using the word W, beyond logical tautologies and similar trivialities.

A more formal way of expressing this idea is that in first-order logic (or just about any other formal logic you care to choose), if you have a signature S, a predicate P in S, and a theory T over S, if P does not appear in any of the axioms of T then given any model M of T, replacing the interpretation of the predicate P with any other interpretation will still give a you a model of T. XXX: Reference where we unpack these concepts.

Applying the principle to the case of "ought," all observed facts are consistent with essentially any set of moral beliefs, because a purely factual statement is free of moral language. This is the is-ought problem, and it illustrates that no amount of scientific and technological development will provide a justificatory basis in scientific knowledge for our fundamental moral beliefs.

The lesson is that moral beliefs are out of the scope of what science, mathematics, and logic can tell us (though all three practices, especially logic, are important in moral discussions). We cannot reason about morality relying solely on science, mathematics, and logic. However, we can reason about morality, which illustrates that rationality takes in more than science, mathematics, and logic.

Legal reasoning is another good example. Doing law effectively, in my non-expert understanding, is essentially a matter of using language in clear and consistent ways, thinking through potential futures and accounting for them, and applying consistent principles to different cases. Legal reasoning is a subtle and informal style of reasoning which is nonetheless highly developed and overall well-suited to the problem it solves.






Rationality is not a natural state of the human mind. It's a state which is achieved through hard and determined effort towards the right kinds of goals. It's a state which is never perfectly achieved. One is never finished in the development of one's rationality. It's a life-long learning experience, a path not a destination.

The heart of rationality I also call the Tao of rationality. The Tao of rationality is a mystery, a placeholder for our lack of comprehensive understanding of our own ability to reason, consequent of our minds' present inability to comprehend themselves.

The Tao Te Ching purports to contain ancient wisdom applicable to every kind of problem. In this case we're mining it for wisdom about the practice of rationality. I'll give you a passage, and then I'll tell you what it brings to mind for me.

    The tao that can be told
    is not the eternal Tao
    The name that can be named
    is not the eternal Name.

    The unnamable is the eternally real.
    Naming is the origin
    of all particular things.

    Free from desire, you realize the mystery.
    Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.

    Yet mystery and manifestations
    arise from the same source.
    This source is called darkness.

[N.B. This passage is from chapter 1 of [Stephen Mitchell's translation of the Tao Te Ching](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html), for which I claim fair use. Consider buying it; it's a great book.]

Here's what that passage brings to mind for me.

Human ability to reason outruns our ability to understand our processes of reasoning on a second-order level. Reasoning is a capability of our minds. Our minds are very complex and our understanding of them is very rudimentary.

Our processes of reasoning are the outcome of a process of biological and social evolution, consisting of the Darwinian evolution of our brains and the transmission and evolution of intellectual DNA forward through history.

Our rules for reasoning are essentially encoded in our languages. Our languages are complex organs with many subdivisions such as mathematical language and technical jargon of various fields, which are outposts dotted around a complex, generalized "everyday" language.

The most important wisdom about reasoning is contained in the rules governing our everyday languages. Good argumentation is mostly a matter of using everyday language in a way which adheres rigorously to common sense best practices of clarity and thoroughness. In other words, deeply understanding common sense about how to use language when attempting to discern the truth is the most important aspect of the development of rationality. 

    The supreme good is like water,
    which nourishes all things without trying to.
    It is content with the low places that people disdain.
    Thus it is like the Tao.

    In dwelling, live close to the ground.
    In thinking, keep to the simple.
    In conflict, be fair and generous.

    [ch. 8]

Good reasoning is full of uniform and repeatable patterns. Some of these repeatable patterns can be systematized: for example, deductive logic, mathematics, and science all have a corpus of repeatable reasoning techniques of various degrees of formality. Understanding these patterns is important to the development of rationality.

However, knowing all the techniques of rationality does not give one the practical, procedural knowledge of being rational.

    When you have names and forms,
    know that they are provisional.
    When you have institutions,
    know where their functions should end.
    Knowing when to stop,
    you can avoid any danger.
    
    [ch. 32]

The heart of rationality is a groundedness in reality and a willingness to be swayed by reality created by a kind of emptiness and lack of preconception.

    We join spokes together in a wheel,
    but it is the center hole
    that makes the wagon move.

    We shape clay into a pot,
    but it is the emptiness inside
    that holds whatever we want.

    We hammer wood for a house,
    but it is the inner space
    that makes it livable.

    We work with being,
    but non-being is what we use.

    [ch. 11]
