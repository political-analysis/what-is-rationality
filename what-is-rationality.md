What is rationality? "Rationality," being a nebulous, imprecise term, can mean many different things. However, our goal here is not to explore everything the word could or should mean. Our goal is develop a usable, practical theory of rationality.

It is not productive to try to answer question "what is rationality?" by coming up with a dictionary definition of rationality, a sentence of the form "rationality is..." Rationality is too complex a concept to explain with a dictionary definition.

Here is a first pass attempt at explaining rationality in practical terms. Rationality is a set of practices people employ in solving problems. Rationality is involved in the processes we use to organize ourselves into complex societies, develop technologies which improve our standard of living, cure diseases, discover the truth, and solve resource distribution problems (through systems such as capitalist economies), among many other things. 

Given the immense practical importance of rationality, we don't want to approach the understanding of rationality as a purely theoretical problem. We want to approach it as a practical problem, so that our solution will be as useful as possible to as many people as possible. Our goal is not to develop the most rigorous theory possible, but to develop the most usable, and yet correct theory possible.

There are many perspectives one can take on rationality, but I will start with one: rationality is a form of technology. Rather than being physical, inanimate technology, rationality is mental/cultural technology. It's a complex of memes which we use as tools in solving problems.

Rationality has to do with two areas of human behavior: communication and decision making. We employ rationality in communicating with each other, as when employing arguments to persuade others of something. We also employ rationality in decision making, as when making a purchasing decision, and in innumerable other situations.

We also employ rationality in the course of determining our beliefs. A belief is a type of psychological characteristic of a person. Many analyses of rationality place great focus on beliefs. The trouble with this is that it gets one into the muddy area of psychology.

In our analysis, we will take a different approach, by focusing on communication and decision making as the primary loci of concern of rationality. Generally conclusions about rules of rational argumentation will trivially yield analogous conclusions about rules of rational belief-determination.

There are two reasons for examining rationality primary through the lenses of communication and decision making. The first is that these are the primary observable manifestations of rationality, and observable things are easier to discuss. The second is that they are where the rubber hits the pavement in practical situations involving rationality, and therefore the most useful loci to analyze from a practical perspective.

Now let us examine the notion of the "laws of rationality." On my reading, discovering the laws of rationality has been the foremost goal of the study of rationality since that study's inception. This reading will be substantiated later in the "history of rationality" section.

What are the laws of rationality? First of all, they are laws. What are laws? As with most words, we will take a descriptivist perspective on the word "law." For us, the things that are laws will be the things which are called laws in common usage. The fact that common usage has some inconsistencies regarding what constitutes a law is not an obstacle to sufficiently clear communication for us, and when it is we will clarify.

The main areas of law are [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law), [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law), [moral law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics), the laws of rationality, the laws of [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality) and other areas of [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality), and the [systems of laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_history) of every government in the present and the past. Generally speaking, each of these areas of law has or had broadly agreed upon principles, institutions dedicated to their study and practice, textual sources of various kinds and degrees of authority, and specialized vocabulary.

There are also various other laws referenced in common usage, such as [Duverger's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger's_law) [law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo), [Godwin's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law), [the law of diminishing returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns), and [Murphy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law). These laws don't obviously fall into any of the aforementioned categories, but they are still laws for us on account of common usage.

What do all the laws we can think of have in common, and what don't they have in common? Not all laws always hold true (e.g. Murphy's law). Not all laws carry a penalty for their violation (e.g. Godwin's law). Some laws are created by humans; others (e.g. the laws of physics) are not. Some areas of law have centralized authorities (e.g. the laws of governments) that decide the law; others (e.g. the laws of morality) do not.

All laws bind us and/or the world, in some sense and at least in some cases. The sense in which laws are binding varies.

 * The laws of physics are binding in the sense that physical theories generally postulate laws that always hold within their domain of applicability, so that any counterexamples would falsify the theory.
 * Sociological laws like Duverger's law and Godwin's law are expected to have some counterexamples, or perhaps many counterexamples as in the case of Godwin's law, and counterexamples are not necessarily considered to undermine the whole law.
 * The laws of governments are binding in the sense (and to the extent) that they can be enforced and offenses are punishable. Many consider the laws of governments to be binding in a moral sense in many cases. It seems to be a consensus among the people I speak to that laws of governments are not always binding in a moral sense, but I imagine this perspective is not shared by the whole world. For example, many Islamists undoubtedly would agree that sharia law is binding in a moral sense. (XXX: source?)
 * International law is binding on states in a moral sense, and it is also binding in the sense (and to the extent) that it is enforceable and offenses are punishable, which varies widely from case to case.

I can't think of any counterexamples to the generalization that all laws are binding, to something in some sense in some cases. This, then, is one truism about laws which we will accept.

In what sense are the laws of rationality binding? In many different senses, in many different contexts:

 * In debates, the laws of rationality are binding as a matter of social norms. The laws of rationality are broken on a regular basis in debates, probably in most debates. However, we still agree that in some sense those who break them are not debating correctly.
 * In academic contexts, the laws of rationality are binding as a matter of professional standards. In the context of academic publishing the laws of rationality are enforceable by the peer review process.
 * In many professional contexts, such as when performing a technical job such as software development or security analysis, the laws of rationality are binding as a matter of professional ethics, especially in mission-critical scenarios.
 * In serious contexts where you need to solve a problem, rationality is usually applicable. In these cases, the laws of rationality are binding in the sense that following them maximizes your likelihood of success. (If following a set of principles of rationality reduced your likelihood of success, then those principles would be a flawed way of thinking about rationality.)












With that in mind, the theory should be built on the analysis of many particular cases of reasoning across all fields, with the central focus being placed upon common, everyday cases. The central cases to be addressed by the theory are cases of reasoning problems that come up in practical affairs of living, in the workplace, in interpersonal relationships, in politics, and in other everyday aspects of life. Reasoning in academic contexts such as science, math, and the humanities is also of importance.

Let us now try to articulate the goal further. Rationality has to do with two areas of human behavior: communication and decision making. We employ rationality in communicating with each other, as when employing arguments to persuade others of the truth of something. We also employ rationality in decision making, as when making a purchasing decision, and in innumerable other situations.

We also employ rationality in the course of determining our beliefs. A belief is a type of psychological characteristic of a person. Many analyses of rationality place great focus on beliefs. The trouble with this is that it gets one into the muddy area of psychology.

In our analysis, we will take a different approach, by focusing on communication and decision making as the primary loci of concern of rationality. Generally conclusions about rules of rational argumentation will trivially yield analogous conclusions about rules of rational belief-determination.

There are two reasons for examining rationality primary through the lenses of communication and decision making. The first is that these are the primary observable manifestations of rationality, and observable things are easier to discuss. The second is that they are where the rubber hits the pavement in practical situations involving rationality, and therefore the most useful loci to analyze from a practical perspective.

We will think of rationality primarily as a set of laws governing communication and decision making. They are not laws in the sense of physical laws, because they are broken all the time by people. They aren't even laws in the sense of moral laws, because sometimes it's appropriate to break the laws of rationality, for example in making a joke which takes the form of a bad argument.

The laws of rationality are wholly non-binding laws that we should choose to follow in practical or serious matters because the long experience of humanity has shown that obeying these laws will help us avoid falsehood, steer towards the truth, persuade others, and make decisions which turn out well.

There is no definitive authority on the laws of rationality. Studies of the laws of rationality have been attempted throughout the history of philosophy, but so far they have always fallen short of comprehensive. I expect that my attempt will fall short of comprehensive as well.

How does one study the laws of rationality? To answer this question, we should look at the study of other forms of law. It will be most productive to look at the study of forms of law which have no centralized authority, since the laws of rationality are of this character. These include international law, common law, and moral law.

The studies of all of these three forms of law have much in common. In each field, principles are established by inductive generalization from specific cases. By appealing to our intuitions of what's fair, what's just, what's good, and so forth, we can establish judgments about specific cases. Some specific cases appear relatively clear-cut to us in that our intuitions tend to align strongly on these cases.

For example. Thor is 32-year-old male. Baba is a 3-year-old male. Thor kills Baba with a knife for no reason. Our intuitions align strongly on this case: we agree that Thor's action is morally wrong. Examining similar cases, most would agree to the generalization, "killing children is wrong."

This shows how clear-cut cases form the bedrock for inductive generalizations which we then apply uniformly across cases. When we encounter specific cases where the generalizations lead to conclusions that do not align with our reasoned or intuitive conclusions about those specific cases, we establish exceptions and our understanding of laws evolves.

For example, the Spartans culled male babies who appeared unfit in order to maintain the quality of their male population. They had a theory about human breeding which they put into practice by culling children. Having discovered a good reason (in their minds) to kill children, the Spartans would revise the principle "killing children is wrong" (if they had previously accepted this principle, which is likely) to exclude the purpose of culling unfit male babies.

This is the central dynamic in the study of areas of law with decentralized authority: inductive generalization from our intuitions on specific cases, and revision of the law when our intuitive or reasond judgments are significantly out of alignment with the conclusion of a generalization on one or more specific cases.

It is probably fair to say that in any of these areas of law, moral, common, and international, there is no such thing as a perfectly unbiased source on the law. Different writers' understandings of the law will probably never be in perfect alignment. However, this is only an issue in practice when their understandings lead to different conclusions on different cases. When different writers may think about things differently but still draw the same conclusions on most concrete cases, one has an area where the law is relatively clear and agreed upon. Of our three areas of law, this probably most true of common law, and least true of moral law, with international law lying somewhere in between.

We are concerned here with a fourth area of law: the laws of rationality. The laws of rationality are relatively clear and agreed upon, as applied to most cases. People often disagree in specific cases about what the laws of rationality say about how to evaluate an argument, but in my experience clear-eyed discussion of the issue usually resolves the disagreement. The laws of rationality alone do not tell us what decisions we should make, and so disagreements about what decisions we should make can sometimes be attributed to disagreements about how the laws of rationality apply, but most often other considerations take priority.

My purpose here is to provide my understanding of the laws of rationality. I don't claim to be innovating anything. I claim to be describing accepted practice and principles as I see them in the world. Of course people don't always adhere to the laws of rationality I describe here, and they don't always agree with these principles, but in my experience clear-eyed discussion brings people around to acceptance of these principles. These principles are also generally agreed upon by other authorities on rationality, or at minimum there is reason to think other authorities would agree with them. Like all accounts of the laws of rationality, this one is biased.

The laws of rationality are inherently flexible. Debates about how the laws of rationality apply in particular cases, and debates about 



# History of rationality

## Ancient Greece

Ancient Greece is often seen as the cradle of modern rationality. Let's look at how it got that reputation.

Athens instituted the first democracy I'm aware of. In democratic Athens, every citizen could influence city policy by means of persuasion in the popular legislature. In this society, strong persuasive abilities had many practical benefits.

The desire to learn persuasive skills was one major driver of demand for teachers, such as the sophists, who made a living providing private tutoring in philosophy and rhetoric, probably most often to the wealthy. We can therefore see how democracy in Greece fueled a flow of money to higher learning.

Greek thinkers made fundamental advances in rationality.

* Euclid studied geometry, providing the first example in my awareness of a systematic mathematical theory where all facts are proven from a set of axioms.
* Aristotle formulated the theory of syllogistic reasoning. This is the first example in my awareness of a formal system of logic, saying what inferences were logically valid for statements in a certain restricted class.
* Greek philosophers constructed sophisticated philosophical arguments, many of which are still quality arguments by the standards of modern philosophy. The Socratic dialogues are one good source of such arguments.
* Greeks studied fundamental problems of epistemology. [Skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism) of various forms was popular in the philosophical community. One form of skepticism is the belief that knowledge is not possible for humans. This view is still hard to refute (which is not to imply that it's true).

The Romans assimilated and built upon Greek thinking. They exported it through their empire to much of Afro-Eurasia. When the Roman Empire fell, Christian monasteries in Western Europe preserved Greco-Roman knowledge through the Dark Ages. Much Medieval learning in Western Europe was concerned with absorbing Greco-Roman knowledge. The Age of Enlightenment was to a great extent driven by Greco-Roman ideas and values, particularly [liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism). Eventually, Western European colonialism and internationalism would export Enlightenment ideas and values to every time zone. This illustrates the extent of the influence of Greco-Roman thought.

The ideals of the Enlightenment include liberalism and rationality. Both ideas are highly Greco-Roman, in content and to some extent in inspiration. So we can see that Greco-Roman thinking is a big part of our cultural, intellectual, and political DNA. In particular, the seeds of our modern Western conception of rationality come from Ancient Greece.

An influential perspective on rationality emerged from the formal study of reasoning pioneered by the likes of Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. Frege and Russell appreciated the importance of the connection between reasoning and language, and their work further demonstrated its importance. By providing a rigorous, mathematical analysis of the essential structure of declarative, factual language, they were able to formulate rigorous, mathematical rules of reasoning which can be used to understand much reasoning in all domains. These rules have particular utility in understanding mathematical reasoning.

The works of Ludwig Wittgenstein emerged, in my understanding, somewhat as a reaction to the Frege-Russell perspective on reasoning. Wittgenstein agreed on the importance of the connection between language and reasoning. However, he ultimately provided a radically different understanding of language than the one suggested by Frege and Russell's formal analysis.

XXX: Explain the view I'm refuting, ala Frege, Russell

At the end of the day, rationality is a *praxis*. It is something that we do, rather than something we understand. There is a lot of academic theory involved in modern rationality. This theory is important. But, somebody who has a grasp of the academic theory relevant to rationality is not, thereby, rational. The heart of rationality is something we can't explain; our understanding of ourselves isn't advanced enough for us to figure it out.

One good way of defining rationality is as the *praxis* involved in thinking in such a way as to be correct, and in making decisions in such a way as to be maximally assured of achieving our goals. In [Eliezer Yudkowsy's words](http://lesswrong.com/lw/7i/rationality_is_systematized_winning/), rationality is systematized winning.

Like all philosophical theses, this conception can surely be picked at. It's a pretty good way of thinking about rationality, though. It gives us a key principle of rationality, which is that rationality is not about adhering to a fixed set of rules. A rational person does what works. Our conceptions of what works can be overturned, so rationality does not have any fixed principles.

However, there are principles that have always worked, for which we can't conceive of any realistic scenarios where they wouldn't work within their established domains of applicability. These include the laws of logic, the laws of mathematics, and the scientific method.

The term "law" should not necessarily be understood here in the sense of "law of nature." For example, are the laws of mathematics laws of nature? Or are they conventions? There's [an entire field of philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-mathematics/) whose central question is essentially that. However, we can certainly say that mathematics and logic as practiced by humans are linguistic practices whose rules have been written down by humans, which we use because they work.

Are the laws of logic, the laws of mathematics, and the scientific method applicable to everything? Certainly not. They cannot tell us anything about what is good or bad, moral or immoral. They do not presently allow us to understand each other; we need to rely on feelings and intuition to understand each other. They do not tell us how to lead a happy life, a meaningful life, or a spiritual life.

Some people will argue that sufficiently advanced science and technology could allow us to understand each other and understand the secrets of happiness, meaning, and spiritual life through logic, math, and science. It may be true that sufficiently advanced understanding of neuroscience will shed light on all these topics.

This is largely an irrelevant point, because we don't possess the requisite science and technology to understand things in this way, and such science and technology appears to be a long way off, barring a [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity).

It also risks missing the significance of the [is-ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem) described by Hume. Intuitively, it seems clear that no set of purely descriptive, factual statements about the world logically entail any moral proposition, any statement of "ought."

Let's try it. "Jimmy *is* in pain," therefore "we *ought* to have sympathy for Jimmy." This argument has a suppressed premise, namely, "we ought to have sympathy for people who are in pain," which in turn appears to rest on more basic assumptions like "pain is bad" and "we ought to sympathize with people experiencing bad things." How do we justify these assumptions on the basis of factual claims?

We can also analyze the matter from a logical perspective. Suppose we have a set of premises P, and a word W. Suppose the word W never appears in P. Then it will be impossible to prove any statement using the word W, beyond logical tautologies and similar trivialities.

A more formal way of expressing this idea is that in first-order logic (or just about any other formal logic you care to choose), if you have a signature S, a predicate P in S, and a theory T over S, if P does not appear in any of the axioms of T then given any model M of T, replacing the interpretation of the predicate P with any other interpretation will still give a you a model of T. XXX: Reference where we unpack these concepts.

Applying the principle to the case of "ought," all observed facts are consistent with essentially any set of moral beliefs, because a purely factual statement is free of moral language. This is the is-ought problem, and it illustrates that no amount of scientific and technological development will provide a justificatory basis in scientific knowledge for our fundamental moral beliefs.

The lesson is that moral beliefs are out of the scope of what science, mathematics, and logic can tell us (though all three practices, especially logic, are important in moral discussions). We cannot reason about morality relying solely on science, mathematics, and logic. However, we can reason about morality, which illustrates that rationality takes in more than science, mathematics, and logic.

Legal reasoning is another good example. Doing law effectively, in my non-expert understanding, is essentially a matter of using language in clear and consistent ways, thinking through potential futures and accounting for them, and applying consistent principles to different cases. Legal reasoning is a subtle and informal style of reasoning which is nonetheless highly developed and overall well-suited to the problem it solves.






Rationality is not a natural state of the human mind. It's a state which is achieved through hard and determined effort towards the right kinds of goals. It's a state which is never perfectly achieved. One is never finished in the development of one's rationality. It's a life-long learning experience, a path not a destination.

The heart of rationality I also call the Tao of rationality. The Tao of rationality is a mystery, a placeholder for our lack of comprehensive understanding of our own ability to reason, consequent of our minds' present inability to comprehend themselves.

The Tao Te Ching purports to contain ancient wisdom applicable to every kind of problem. In this case we're mining it for wisdom about the practice of rationality. I'll give you a passage, and then I'll tell you what it brings to mind for me.

    The tao that can be told
    is not the eternal Tao
    The name that can be named
    is not the eternal Name.

    The unnamable is the eternally real.
    Naming is the origin
    of all particular things.

    Free from desire, you realize the mystery.
    Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.

    Yet mystery and manifestations
    arise from the same source.
    This source is called darkness.

[N.B. This passage is from chapter 1 of [Stephen Mitchell's translation of the Tao Te Ching](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html), for which I claim fair use. Consider buying it; it's a great book.]

Here's what that passage brings to mind for me.

Human ability to reason outruns our ability to understand our processes of reasoning on a second-order level. Reasoning is a capability of our minds. Our minds are very complex and our understanding of them is very rudimentary.

Our processes of reasoning are the outcome of a process of biological and social evolution, consisting of the Darwinian evolution of our brains and the transmission and evolution of intellectual DNA forward through history.

Our rules for reasoning are essentially encoded in our languages. Our languages are complex organs with many subdivisions such as mathematical language and technical jargon of various fields, which are outposts dotted around a complex, generalized "everyday" language.

The most important wisdom about reasoning is contained in the rules governing our everyday languages. Good argumentation is mostly a matter of using everyday language in a way which adheres rigorously to common sense best practices of clarity and thoroughness. In other words, deeply understanding common sense about how to use language when attempting to discern the truth is the most important aspect of the development of rationality. 

    The supreme good is like water,
    which nourishes all things without trying to.
    It is content with the low places that people disdain.
    Thus it is like the Tao.

    In dwelling, live close to the ground.
    In thinking, keep to the simple.
    In conflict, be fair and generous.

    [ch. 8]

Good reasoning is full of uniform and repeatable patterns. Some of these repeatable patterns can be systematized: for example, deductive logic, mathematics, and science all have a corpus of repeatable reasoning techniques of various degrees of formality. Understanding these patterns is important to the development of rationality.

However, knowing all the techniques of rationality does not give one the practical, procedural knowledge of being rational.

    When you have names and forms,
    know that they are provisional.
    When you have institutions,
    know where their functions should end.
    Knowing when to stop,
    you can avoid any danger.
    
    [ch. 32]

The heart of rationality is a groundedness in reality and a willingness to be swayed by reality created by a kind of emptiness and lack of preconception.

    We join spokes together in a wheel,
    but it is the center hole
    that makes the wagon move.

    We shape clay into a pot,
    but it is the emptiness inside
    that holds whatever we want.

    We hammer wood for a house,
    but it is the inner space
    that makes it livable.

    We work with being,
    but non-being is what we use.

    [ch. 11]

















# A neo-Socratic conception of rationality
